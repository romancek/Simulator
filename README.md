Simulator
=========
This is simulate the distributed system.

Node has any algorithms and channels.
These nodes synchronous wake up.

* `.NET Framework v4.5.51209`
* `boost 1.56.0`

##Property

* `n` : number of nodes
* `m` : number of edges
* `F` : channels
* Graph topology
	* `Random` or `Unit Disk`
